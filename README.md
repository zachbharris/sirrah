## To run locally

2. `npm install` to snatch the required dependencies
3. `npm i -g gatsby-cli` to globally install the gatsby command line interface
4. `gatsby develop` to begin the development server

## Disclaimer

Even though this is a public repo I ask kindly that you do not directly copy from this repository. Lots of drinking and keyboard bashing happened during this development process and it&apos;d be super unfair for you to just grab whatever you want.
