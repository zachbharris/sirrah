## To run locally

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install` to snatch the required dependencies
3. `npm start` to begin the development server

## Disclaimer

Even though this is a public repo I ask kindly that you do not directly copy from this repository. Lots of drinking and keyboard bashing happened during this development process and it&apos;d be super unfair for you to just grab whatever you want.
